    <h2>The Hobby</h2>
    <p>
      My brother introduced me into playing video games when I was pretty young.
      Being that I looked up to him, it's easy to see why I ended up liking
      video games too. It first started with the Nintendo 64 and has now
      progressed all the way to the Xbox One. It's something I like to do in my
      free time and will always try to get my friends to play with as it's
      always a good time to play games with them. On this site, you can observe
      my current collection of video games.
